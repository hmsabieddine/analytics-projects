# Project Phase 2 - Regression Modeling and Diagnostics 

This project focuses on developing and evaluating multiple linear regression models to understand predictive relationships within the dataset. The analysis includes coefficient interpretation, diagnostic testing, and business-focused insights.

## Objective 

* Build regression models to predict key outcomes
* Assess statistical significance of predictors
* Evaluate model assumptions
* Interpret model implications for decision-making

## Tasks Completed 
* Constructed multiple linear regression models using R
* Interpreted coefficients, p-values, and model fit statistics
* Performed diagnostic tests, including: Residual plots, Q-Q Plots, Fitted vs. actual comparisons.
* Checked linearity, independence, and normality assumptions
* Identified potential outliers and variance patterns
* Explained business meaning of model results

## Tools and Libraries 
* R
* GGplot
* dplyr
* stats package

## Files included 
* ProjectPhase2.html — full analysis report

## Key Insights 
* Identified significant predictors that impact the target variable
* Evaluated strength of relationships using R² and adjusted R²
* Discussed limitations of the model and next steps for improvement
